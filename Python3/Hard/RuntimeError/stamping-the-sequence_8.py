        # The idea is to replace the target with '?'s when we can
        # and keep track of the index of the left-most letter
        # that is stamped. We can do this by replacing the target
        # with '?'s and then checking if thtarget s equal to
        # the tamp after each replacement.
        # We can also check if the target is equal to the stamp
        # before we begin replacing the target with '?'s. If it
        # is, then we can return immediately.

        # after we replace the target with '?'s. If it is, then
        # we can return immediately.

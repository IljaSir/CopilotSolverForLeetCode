    def splitNum(self, num: int) -> int:
        
        # 1. Get the number of occurrences of each digit in num.
        # 2. Split num into two numbers num1 and num2.
        # 3. The concatenation of num1 and num2 is a permutation of num.
        # 4. The sum of the number of occurrences of each digit in num1 and num2 is equal to the number of occurrences of that digit in num.
        # 5. num1 and num2 can contain leading zeros.
        # 6. Return the minimum possible sum of num1 and num2.
        # 7. It is guaranteed that num does not contain any leading zeros.
        # 8. The order of occurrence of the digits in num1 and num2 may differ from the order of occurrence of num.
        # 9. num1 and num2 can contain leading zeros.
        # 10. Return the minimum possible sum of num1 and num2.
        # 11. It is guaranteed that num does not contain any leading zeros.
        # 12. The order of occurrence of the digits in num1 and num2 may differ from the order of occurrence of num.
        # 13. num1 and num2 can contain leading zeros.
        # 14. Return the minimum possible sum of num1 and num2.
        # 15. It is guaranteed that num does not contain any leading zeros.
        # 16. The order of occurrence of the digits in num1 and num2 may differ from the order of occurrence of num.
        # 17. num1 and num2 can contain leading zeros.
        # 18. Return the minimum possible sum of num1 and num2.
        # 19. It is guaranteed that num does not contain any leading zeros.
        # 20. The order of occurrence of the digits in num1 and num2 may differ from the order of occurrence of num.

class Solution:
    def canThreePartsEqualSum(self, arr: List[int]) -> bool:
        
        # 1. Find the sum of the array.
        # 2. Check if the sum is divisible by 3. If not, return False.
        # 3. Find the target sum.
        # 4. Check if the target sum can be reached by adding consecutive elements.
        # 5. If the target sum cannot be reached, return False.
        # 6. If the target sum can be reached, return True.
        # 7. Time complexity: O(n)
        # 8. Space complexity: O(1)
        # 9. Edge cases: 
        #    a. If the array is empty, return False.
        #    b. If the array has only one element, return False.
        #    c. If the array has only two elements, return False.
        #    d. If the array has only three elements, return True if the sum of the array is divisible by 3.
        # 10. Notes:

        # The idea is to count the number of pairs with the same remainder.
        # If the remainder is 0, then we need to count the number of pairs with the same value.
        # Otherwise, we need to count the number of pairs with the same value and the same remainder.
        # The number of pairs with the same value and the same remainder is the number of pairs with the same remainder.
        # The number of pairs with the same value is the number of pairs with the same remainder plus 1.
        # The number of pairs with the same value and the same remainder is the number of pairs with the same remainder.
        # The number of pairs with the same value is the number of pairs with the same remainder plus 1.

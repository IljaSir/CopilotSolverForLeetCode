        # 1. We need to check the neighbors of each element in the array
        # 2. If the neighbors are smaller than the current element, we have a hill
        # 3. If the neighbors are larger than the current element, we have a valley
        # 4. If the neighbors are equal to the current element, we don't have a hill or valley
        # 5. If the neighbors are not equal to the current element, we can have a hill or valley
        # 6. We need to check the neighbors on both the left and right of the current element
        # 7. We can have multiple hills and valleys in the array
        # 8. We need to return the number of hills and valleys in the array
        # 9. We can have a hill and valley at the same index
        # 10. We can have a hill and valley at the same index
        # 11. We can have a hill and valley at the same index

"""
You are given a m x n matrix grid. Initially, you are located at the top-left corner (0, 0), and in each step, you can only move right or down in the matrix.

Among all possible paths starting from the top-left corner (0, 0) and ending in the bottom-right corner (m - 1, n - 1), find the path with the maximum non-negative product. The product of a path is the product of all integers in the grid cells visited along the path.

Return the maximum non-negative product modulo 10^9 + 7. If the maximum product is negative, return -1.

Notice that the modulo is performed after getting the maximum product.

 
Example 1:


Input: grid = [[-1,-2,-3],[-2,-3,-3],[-3,-3,-2]]
Output: -1
Explanation: It is not possible to get non-negative product in the path from (0, 0) to (2, 2), so return -1.


Example 2:


Input: grid = [[1,-2,1],[1,-2,1],[3,-4,1]]
Output: 8
Explanation: Maximum non-negative product is shown (1 * 1 * -2 * -4 * 1 = 8).


Example 3:


Input: grid = [[1,3],[0,-4]]
Output: 0
Explanation: Maximum non-negative product is shown (1 * 0 * -4 = 0).


 
Constraints:


	m == grid.length
	n == grid[i].length
	1 <= m, n <= 15
	-4 <= grid[i][j] <= 4
